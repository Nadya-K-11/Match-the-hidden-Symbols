"Match The Hidden Symbols" is a logical game for memory and concentration.
The playing field is a board with 6 rows × 12 columns - a total of 72 tiles. Under each tile is a hidden symbol.

There are only 6 different symbols, each occurring 12 times, which makes the game faster and more dynamic.

Game rules:
Start: Press the Start Game button to generate a new shuffled field.
Move: Turn over two tiles per turn. If the symbols match - they remain open. If not - after a short pause they are turned over.
Moves: At the beginning you have 150 moves. Each click reduces their number. If they run out - the game ends.
Points: Each discovered pair brings 10 points. A series of successful moves activates a "streak", which increases points progressively (for each consecutive pair you earn like this:
2nd consecutive pair +20 points, 3rd pair +30, 4th +40, etc.)

Special buttons:
Pause – stops time
Hint (-10 pts) – shows a possible pair
Buy +10 Moves (-10 pts) – buy 10 moves for 10 points
Reset – restarts the current field
New Game – new field
Submit Result – saves the result
Exit – returns to the home page

Logic and strategy:
Remember the positions of the flipped tiles.
Use "Hint" if you need a hint.
Balance between moves and points – it's better to spend points to buy moves, but to win the game!
